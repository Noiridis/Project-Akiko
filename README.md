# Planned Features:
## Backend Features:
- Connect to Kobold, Ooba, horde, or use Akiko's own backend. With Pygmalion and LLaMA support.
- Emotion Detection.
- Long-term and Short Term memory summarization.
- Image captioning.
- Stable Diffusion (probably).
## Chat with Characters:
- Character creation and character management with exports to Character Cards (TavernCardPNG).
- Chat with your favorite Character through a polished UI. 
- Chat with multiple characters in character groups.
- Chat regeneration (swipes), Editable Messages, Impersonation, Branching Chats.
- Emotion detection with corresponding emotional display for set-characters (configuration required).
- Send images to your character and have them recognize what the image is.
- Live2D models with emotion display.
- Text-to-speech with AzureTTS or (maybe) other alternatives. (this will also allow you to see lips moving on Live2D models.)
### Custom Chat Settings:
- Configure whether or not you want your bot to know what the current time of day is.
- Configure 'time since' to show your bot how long it has been since you last messaged them.
- Configure your relationship to the bot (Friend, Lover, Wife/Husband, Sibling, Custom Value, etc).
- Configure 'consent' for certain actions for more 'realism'.
## Multi-user Support:
This feature and it's components will be optional.
- User sign-on/sign-up.
- Allow authorized users to access application settings.
- Have a user profile custom to you and your other users.
- Be able to invite users to chat with you and your AI with user recognition.
- See other user's stats (how many messages they've sent, what their favorite Character is, etc.)
- See a Character's creator.
- Character sharing (or not).
## Twitch integration: 
- Create your own AI VTuber like Neurosama!
- See and manage Twitch Stats and Chats from inside Project Akiko UI.
- Manage AI output so it is Twitch filtered (no more holocaust jokes!).
## Discord Bot Integration:
- Chat with your bot through discord.
- Send images to the bot.
- Ask for images from the bot (spicy or not).
- Custom Chat Settings are also available on the discord bot.
